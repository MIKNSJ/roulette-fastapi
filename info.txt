========== DOCKER INFO ========================================================
These commands will run the backend, but there is no hot reload.
docker build -t roulette-backend .
docker run --name rb1 -p 80:80

These commands will run the backend and provide hot reloads.
Run: docker-compose up (--build: Optional) based on the following:
    - initial build
    - modified the dockerfile, .dockerignore, and/or docker-compose.yaml/.yml
        - if modified, then add --build

Run: docker stop <container-name> to stop the container in the terminal.
Run: docker restart <container-name> to rerun the container in the terminal.
NOTE: Restarting the container will hide logs, so use Docker Desktop or add
optional flags before executing the commands.
Ex:  docker-compose logs -f <container_name>
NOTE: There is an issue where modifying .html, .css, or .js files can cause
errors that prevent the docker-compose container to be ran. To fix this
temporary, delete the existing container and rebuild with docker-compose up.
NOTE: It appears that .html, .css, or .js files do not have hot reloading even
with forced refresh, so rebuild the docker-compose container to see the new
changes.
